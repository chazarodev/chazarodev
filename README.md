Since the beginning of coronavirus I started to learn code. I started with C, C++ and Java, then saw a little about python.
I realized that i had to start learning about web development so I begun whit HTML5 and CSS3 and added javascript. 
In fact i get funny doing stuff on the web so I had get more deep on javascript and its frameworks. 
So here I am, one path took me to another.
