👋 Hi, I'm @chazarodev
👀 I'm interested in web development with the MERN stack using JavaScript, as well as Python development and task automation with shellscript in Linux systems. I also have basic knowledge in cybersecurity and networking from the Cisco cybersecurity course.
🌱 I'm currently learning new technologies and frameworks to enhance my web development and task automation skills.
💞️ I would love to collaborate on projects involving web application development and task automation.
